# Repro-Build: Reproducible Builds with Nix

## Project Description

Repro-Build is a tool designed to provide bit-for-bit reproducible builds for Rust software (with plans to expand to other languages) using Nix inside Docker containers. The core philosophy is to achieve the highest degree of reproducibility by controlling every aspect of the build environment:

- Precise Docker image version for Nix
- Exact Rust toolchain version
- Specific system library versions (glibc, musl)
- Defined compiler flags and linking options
- Controlled dependency resolution

This project simplifies the complex process of creating reproducible development environments with Nix by templating the most common tools and cross-compilation setups. By leveraging Nix flakes, we can create hermetic build environments that are guaranteed to produce the same output regardless of the host system.

The tool automatically generates the necessary Nix flake files, manages Docker containers, and orchestrates the build process across multiple targets. This allows developers to easily create cross-platform builds without deep knowledge of Nix or Docker.

Key features:
- Cross-compilation for multiple targets (Linux x86_64/ARM64, Windows MSVC/GNU)
- Static linking options
- Custom Rust channel selection (stable, nightly)
- Support for specific Rust versions
- Additional Nix input management
- Rich progress reporting during builds

## Tasks

### Core Functionality
- [x] Add detailed logging to file with all commands executed and terminal output
- [x] Add --list-targets flag to list available targets, default to building for host when no targets specified
- [ ] Add support for easy package templating with static compilation options
- [ ] Create a mechanism to add custom commands to the Docker container
- [ ] Implement support for macOS cross-compilation (osxcross)
- [ ] Add development shells with custom build commands
- [ ] Support for minimal Docker image builds
- [ ] Add Podman compatibility as an alternative to Docker
- [ ] Simplify target triple specification with defaults and static options

### Language Support
- [ ] Add support for Python projects
- [ ] Add support for Java projects
- [ ] Add support for C# projects
- [ ] Enable polyglot projects (combining multiple languages)
- [ ] Create templates for common language combinations

### User Experience
- [ ] Improve error reporting and recovery options
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation with examples
- [x] Create Rust crate with build.rs integration for seamless dependency-based usage

### Integration
- [ ] CI/CD system integration helpers
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow templates
- [ ] GitLab CI templates
- [ ] Add cache management for faster rebuilds
- [ ] Support build artifact publication
